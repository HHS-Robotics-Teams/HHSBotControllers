# This is the template for our team repositories! 
## This can pull updates from upstream (the canonical FTC repository) and those updates will be able to be passed down to all our team-specific repositories.

Shared code might go here since it's a team-agnostic repository. If we're sure everyone wants something, it can be committed to master and passed down to team master branches from one centralized location.
Make sure for general bot-specific commits you're pushing to your team's specific respository and not this one, though! You can find those listed under the HHS-Robotics-Teams organization. (the link should be in the top left on desktop)
